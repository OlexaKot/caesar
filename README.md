To encrypt a message, use the encrypt() function that takes in two arguments: plaintext (a string) and the key (integer) and outputs the ciphertext.

To decrypt a message, use the decrypt() function that likewise takes in two arguments: ciphertext (a string) and the key (integer) and outputs the plaintext.
