# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, who used it in his private correspondence.

To encrypt a message, use the encrypt() function that takes in two arguments: the plaintext (a string) and the key (integer) and outputs the ciphertext.

To decrypt a message, use the decrypt() function that likewise takes in two arguments: the ciphertext (a string) and the key (integer) and outputs the plaintext.

To crack a message with brute force, use the crack() function that takes in one single argument which is the ciphertext (a string) and outputs every possible variation of the message (26 variations) where only one of 26 variations is the plaintext of the message.
